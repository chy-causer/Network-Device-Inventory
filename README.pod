=head1 INTRODUCTION

This is a network device inventory that was written in 2007 and used
internally to feed a network monitoring system. It was approved for release as
open source code on the 10th February 2012

At the time of public release the code is still in the process of being
'publicified' so may make references to in house systems or be in a non
working state, it's intended to fix this as soon as possible.

The major steps currently involve:

 Make a database using the SQL in conf/*.sql

 Copy the perl modules into place on the webserver

 Copy the perl scripts, templates, images and stylesheets into the wbeservers directory

This process will be significantly improved shortly.

=head1 FUTURE WORK
