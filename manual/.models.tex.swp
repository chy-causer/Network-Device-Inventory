Inventory::Models - Information on Models

\subsection*{VERSION\label{VERSION}\index{VERSION}}


This document describes Inventory::Models version 0.0.1

\section{SYNOPSIS\label{SYNOPSIS}\index{SYNOPSIS}}
\begin{verbatim}
  use Inventory::Models qw(create_models edit_models show_models_info count_hosts_permodel);
  # There are no special setup requirements
\end{verbatim}
\section{PURPOSE\label{PURPOSE}\index{PURPOSE}}


If you wish to investigate what models exist in the database or want to
investigate how popular each model is, then this module assists in that
process. A subroutine is provided for each of: creating, editing, listing all
entries, and listing summary totals of the relationships.

\section{DESCRIPTION\label{DESCRIPTION}\index{DESCRIPTION}}


The module aims to hide the tasks of raw SQL queries to the database from wou
when performing common tasks which involve the relationhips of models to hosts
in the inventory table.



The data returned from a query should be generous, as well as the ids of the
models involved the names, statuses and similar are available. Each subroutine
should also give a descriptive success or failure message.

\subsection*{Main Subroutines\label{Main_Subroutines}\index{Main Subroutines}}
\subsubsection*{create\_models(\$dbh,\$hashref)\label{create_models_dbh_hashref_}\index{create\ models(\$dbh,\$hashref)}}


\$dbh is the database handle for the Inventory Database



This subrouting will always return a hashref with the SUCCESS or ERROR state recorded in the hash key and the human description recorded in the hash keys value, e.g.
\$message\{'SUCCESS'\} = 'Your changes were commited successfully';

\subsubsection*{edit\_models(\$dbh,\$hashref)
=head3 list\_models\_info(\$dbh,\$optional\_manufacturersid)
=head3 count\_hosts\_permodel(\$dbh)\label{edit_models_dbh_hashref_head3_list_models_info_dbh_optional_manufacturersid_head3_count_hosts_permodel_dbh_}\index{edit\ models(\$dbh,\$hashref)
=head3 list\ models\ info(\$dbh,\$optional\ manufacturersid)
=head3 count\ hosts\ permodel(\$dbh)}}
\section{CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT\label{CONFIGURATION_AND_ENVIRONMENT}\index{CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT}}


A postgres database with the database layout that's expected by the overall
Inventory module is required. Other configuration is at the application level
via a configuration file loaded via Config::Tiny in the calling script, but
this module itself is only passed the resulting database handle.
